## What You Can Do

- **Get main topics covered** automatically when you start

- **Export conversations** to clipboard or save to a file for later reference
- Get answers with **precise timestamps** showing where information appears in the video

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- Google API Key for Gemini API
  - Get one at: https://ai.google.dev/

```

### What Happens Next

1. **Video loads** - You'll see the title, author, and duration
2. **Topics summary** - Main topics covered in the video are automatically generated

Assistant: [Answer with relevant timestamps]

You: Can you tell me more about [specific topic]?
Assistant: [Detailed explanation with timestamps]

You: What are the key takeaways?
Assistant: [Summary with references to video sections]
```

### Export Your Conversation

Save your conversation for later reference:

```
You: /export
```

Choose to either:

## Tips for Best Results

- **Videos must have captions** - The video needs transcripts/subtitles available
- **Be specific** - Clear questions get better answers
- **Follow up** - Ask for more details or clarification on any topic
- **Use the summary** - Review the auto-generated topics first to understand what's covered
- **Export often** - Save interesting conversations for later reference

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to load transcript"**
- Video may not have captions enabled
- Try a different video with subtitles

**API Key errors**
- Ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY is set correctly
- Check your API key is valid at https://aistudio.google.com/
